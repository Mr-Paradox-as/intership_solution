To solve this problem in Ruby, we can use a similar approach to the one
outlined above. Here&#39;s some sample code that shows how this could be
implemented:
# Create a 2D array that represents the columns and rows of the airplane
seating_layout = [[3, 4],
[2, 3],
[4, 5],
[3, 4]]
# Set the number of passengers
num_passengers = 30
# Keep track of the current row and seat
row_num = 0
seat_num = 0
# Keep track of the number of seats filled
filled_seats = 0
# Seat passengers until all seats are filled
while filled_seats &lt; num_passengers:
# Check if the current row has any aisle seats
if seating_layout[row_num][0] &gt; 0:
# Seat the next passenger in the first available aisle seat
seating_layout[row_num][0] -= 1
seat_num += 1
filled_seats += 1
# If there are no aisle seats, check if there are any window seats
elif seating_layout[row_num][1] &gt; 0:
# Seat the next passenger in the first available window seat
seating_layout[row_num][1] -= 1
seat_num += 1
filled_seats += 1
# If there are no aisle or window seats, seat the next passenger in a
center seat
else:
# Seat the next passenger in the first available center seat
seating_layout[row_num][2] -= 1
seat_num += 1
filled_seats += 1
# If the last seat in the current row has been filled, move on to the
next row
if seat_num &gt;= seating_layout[row_num][2]:
row_num += 1
seat_num = 0
end
To test this code, we can add some test cases that verify that the
seating layout is filled according to the rules specified in the prompt.
Here are some sample test cases that could be used:
# Test 1: Verify that aisle seats are filled first

seating_layout = [[3, 4],
[2, 3],
[4, 5],
[3, 4]]
num_passengers = 10
assert_equal(seat_passengers(seating_layout, num_passengers), [[2, 4],
[1, 3],
[4, 5],
[3, 4]])
# Test 2: Verify that window seats are filled next
seating_layout = [[0, 4],
[0, 3],
[4, 5],
[3, 4]]
num_passengers = 10
assert_equal(seat_passengers(seating_layout, num_passengers), [[0, 2],
[0, 1],
[4, 5],
[3, 4]])
# Test 3: Verify that center seats are filled last
seating_layout = [[0, 0],
[0, 0],
[4, 5],
[3, 4]]
num_passengers = 10
assert_equal(seat_passengers(seating_layout, num_passengers),
